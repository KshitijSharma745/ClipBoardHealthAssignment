This project contains two challenges - a "Ticket Breakdown" challenge and a "Refactoring" challenge. The two challenges are unrelated, but you should complete both in the same folder and share the link in Coderbyte. Any written answers should be included in markdown files within this folder.




## [Ticket Breakdown](Ticket_Breakdown.md)
Ticket breakdown is related to chunking the big story into small tickets, which can help with story point estimation and effort estimation.


## [Refactoring](Refactoring.md)
Refactoring is important for making sure the code is maintainable and modularised, ensuring each functionality is just doing its job.
Refactoring is a systematic process of improving code without creating new functionality that can transform a mess into clean code and simple design.


If you are a JS novice, here's how to get started:
1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (we use `^16`, the latest LTS)
2. Run `npm i` in this repo to install dependencies
3. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests
4. Run `npm start` to launch `index.js` for any manual testing

Good Luck!!!
